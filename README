# rapidping

# This is a bash script that turns ping for Linux into a "rapid ping" like Cisco or Juniper.

# I'm doing this:
# 
# cp rapping.sh ~/.local/bin/rapping
# echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
# echo "alias ping=rapping">> ~/.bashrc
# sours ~/.bashrc
# 
# 
# dczi@toad[~]$ ping -s 1472 -r 10.205.5.250       
# PING 10.205.5.250 (10.205.5.250) 1472(1500) bytes of data.
